This is our Fall 2020 INST 377 group project.

## Project Description

* Description of your project
* Link to the Heroku instance where your application can be used
* Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones? Which versions?)
* Link to User Manual
* Link to Developer Manual




## Developer Manual
* The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
* They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
* You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
* Your Developer Manual covers:
	* How to install your application and all dependencies
	* How to run your application on a server
	* How to run any tests you have written for your software
	* The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
	* A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
