## Information Problem
Most residents of Prince George's County don't have easy access to how county money is being used. For many citizens, the central services expenditures specifically is not a very well known or clarified part of the county budget. This leaves thousands of people in the dark about where their tax payer money is going and how it is being used. Limited access to this information makes it almost impossible for residents to discern whether the best solutions and decisions are being made for the county and their communities.

## Identified Stakeholders/Target Browsers
* **Prince George's County Government**
The Prince George's County government would obviously be a stakeholder in this project because we would hope that the government has an interest in the success of this project and wants to see their citizens more informed and involved.

* **Residents of Prince George's County**
The residents of Prince George's County  are stakeholders because they are being directly impacted by the outcome of our application. Should our project be successful they would be able to access and understand their local government spending and how their tax money is being utilized. 

## Data You Chose to Work With

## Chosen Strategies/Solutions

## Technical System Decision Rationale
We chose to use Bulma for a plethora of reasons. First, Bulma is responsive. It will look great on both mobile and desktop, and based on flexbox, our favorite! Second, it's modular.. Bulma allowed us to pick and choose relevant elements such as tabs, navigation bar, dropdown (and more!). Lastly, it's aesthetic was appealing. Bulma builds beautiful minimalist pages that will make our app look modern.

## How Our Final System Adressess the Problem

## Challenges Faced and Impact on Final Design
* One of our first challenges was realizing retrieval was limited to 1000 records at a time. Our initial solution to part of this issue would be use of a token, but we did not have enough time to implement one for a greater volume of data intake
* Another challenge we faced was having to reduce our bar chart options. A closer look at the data revealed values for two columns were nearly always the same. We decided columns with no distinguishable categories were useless for drawing conclusions and eliminated them from our options
* Functions inside event listeners inside functions inside event listeners. Complicated script was difficult to debug and data ended up getting lost or passed incorrectly. To resolve this we implemented a main thread that eliminated nesting and was able to handle all event listeners and functions.
