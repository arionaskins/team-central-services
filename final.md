## Information Problem
Most residents of Prince George's County don't have easy access to how county money is being used. For many citizens, the central services expenditures specifically is not a very well known or clarified part of the county budget. This leaves thousands of people in the dark about where their tax payer money is going and how it is being used. Limited access to this information makes it almost impossible for residents to discern whether the best solutions and decisions are being made for the county and their communities.
